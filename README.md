# AI Chatbot Project

This project is an AI chatbot implemented in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Pandas.

## Features

### User-Friendly Interface
- The chatbot offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it accessible to users without technical expertise.

### Text-to-Voice Capability
- The chatbot can convert text responses into speech, providing a more engaging and accessible experience for users who prefer voice interactions.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Specially designed a well-structured GUI for easy navigation and an enhanced user experience.

## Installation
Before you can run the AI Chatbot on your local machine, you need to install the following Python libraries using `pip`:

### tkinter
Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides the necessary tools to build interactive windows and interfaces.
To install tkinter, use the following command:
```pip install tkinter```

### pyttsx3
Pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech library that allows the chatbot to convert text responses into speech. This feature enhances the user experience, especially for those who prefer voice interactions.
You can install pyttsx3 with the following command:
```pip install pyttsx3```

### numpy
Numpy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. While it's imported as np in the code, it may not be directly used in this specific code snippet. However, it's included as a dependency.
To install numpy, use the following command:
```pip install numpy```

### nltk
Nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library used for natural language processing. It's an essential part of the chatbot's language understanding capabilities.
You can install nltk with the following command:
```pip install nltk```

## Usage
To run the AI Chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:
- Launch the chatbot application by running python chatbot.py.
- Use the GUI to interact with the chatbot.
- Type your questions or messages in the chat window.
- Enjoy the chatbot's responses in both text and voice format!
