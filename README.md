# AI Chatbot Project

This project is an AI chatbot implemented in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Pandas.

## Features

#### User-Friendly Interface
- The chatbot offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it accessible to users without technical expertise.

#### Text-to-Voice Capability
- The chatbot can convert text responses into speech, providing a more engaging and accessible experience for users who prefer voice interactions.

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Specially designed a well-structured GUI for easy navigation and an enhanced user experience.

## Installation
Before you can run the AI Chatbot on your local machine, you need to install the following Python libraries using `pip`:

#### tkinter
Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides the necessary tools to build interactive windows and interfaces. <br>
To install tkinter, use the following command:<br>
```pip install tkinter```

### pyttsx3
Pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech library that allows the chatbot to convert text responses into speech. This feature enhances the user experience, especially for those who prefer voice interactions.<br>
You can install pyttsx3 with the following command:<br>
```pip install pyttsx3```

#### numpy
Numpy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python. While it's imported as np in the code, it may not be directly used in this specific code snippet. However, it's included as a dependency.<br>
To install numpy, use the following command:<br>
```pip install numpy```

#### nltk
Nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) is a library used for natural language processing. It's an essential part of the chatbot's language understanding capabilities.<br>
You can install nltk with the following command:<br>
```pip install nltk```

## Usage
To run the AI Chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:
- Launch the chatbot application by running ```python gui.py```.
- Use the GUI to interact with the chatbot.
- Type your questions or messages in the chat window.
- Enjoy the chatbot's responses in both text and voice format!
